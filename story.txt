This is a story about a boy who wanted to have fun in Wisconsin. He decided to go out to various places on state street. He always had a craving for cheese curds because he never tried them before. 
The boy perused several stores and could not find a worthy curd. He ventured as far as east madison and found an mysterious and an unspoken of arbiter of curds on the madison campus: Culvers.
The curds he ordered there were legendary. He dreamed about them. He had longed for them. How had he lived so long without those juicy bits of happiness?
Oh and do not even forget about the kids meal that he ordered as well. 2 chicken tenders, fries and a milk? What could be better? Oh I know. A free scoop of ice cream. Who Knew!
This boy was having the time of his life. he was walking back to his car all stuffed from his venture. He had an amazing day that day.
